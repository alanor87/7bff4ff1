## Summary

A few remarks on the code :

- I decided not to use UI libraries here, since given the size of the application, any UI library would be a huge overhead.
- mobx-state-tree was used as the state management library, for the sake of separation of concerns as for data fetching.
- the data is being re-fetched on most part of the operations, to keep the backend as the single source of truth.
- the main emphasis was made on the look and fluentness of the UI.
- task has been started on 11.07.24 and finished on 12.07.24, as it was denoted in the deadline instructions.

I want to thank Speer team for the challenge!
